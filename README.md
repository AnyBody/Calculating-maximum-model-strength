# Calculating-maximum-model-strength
AnyScript example which shows the concept of finding the maximum strength

For an detailed description of the concept please see [this blog post](https://anyscript.org/tools/estimating-maximum-model-strength/)

The example contains a simple arm model defined in the simple_arm_model.any file. Further, four movement folders are included, these contain a main file which sets the needed parameters to simulate each movement. 

To run the analyses and calculate the maximum strength for each movement, the max_strength.py script is included.
